## Attacks to Image Classification

In this category, the author usually luanch an attack to an image classifier model, trained using CNN or other machine learning algorithms. A typical way to attack is to add some kind of small **noise** directly to the image (or matrix) and feed it into the target classifier, then get a different (false) classification result.
