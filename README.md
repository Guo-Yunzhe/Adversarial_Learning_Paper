# Adversarial Machine Learning Paper

Papers about **[Adversarial Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_machine_learning)**.

(**Not** to be confused with Generative adversarial network, GAN)

## The FIRST Paper

In this paper, the author first noticed the existence of *adversarial examples* in image classification application.

## Attacks to Image Classification

In this category, the author usually luanch an attack to an image classifier model, trained using CNN or other machine learning algorithms. A typical way to attack is to add some kind of small **noise** directly to the image (or matrix) and feed it into the target classifier, then get a different (false) classification result.

## Defenses

In this category, some defensive techniques are proposed, the way to defense adversarial various and some typical defense method are listed:

- Detecting the adversarial examples
- Increase the robustness of the classifier (especially neural networks)
- Add pre-processing process before feed samples into the classifier
- etc.
